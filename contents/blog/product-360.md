As a fresh YC grad, we needed to build and talk to customers. Product felt like a bureacratic layer which would slow us down.

By PostHog's series B, I realized I was completely wrong!

# Why I used to think this way

My previous experience of product management:

* Here's a list of features the enterprise sales team wants
* How much pipeline does each of these features influence?
* Builds as much of the above as possible whilst trying to manage existing customer requests

Lead to:

* Lots of initial enterprise contracts
* A product users find frustrating to use
* No word of mouth growth
* Customer churn in the long term

# Your company's board will drive this

... just when you thought you were in control of your destiny!

Alas.

Whilst we should measure what matters - often it's what is easiest to measaure that gets measured.

So, what's easy to measure and feels important? Revenue. A B2B SAAS company will default into prioritizing this extremely strongly.

And you should sell more to get more revenue, right?

New business feels quicker than trying to gradually upsell existing users. If product focusses on enabling existing pipeline to close, you end up in the above failure mode.

# Why we've had a great experience

... and here are the actual things we did.

## 1. We got the personalities right

Our product people must be able to empathize with our users. We build for developers, so that meant hiring people that could write a little code. It felt like a compromise to not look for this.

We looked for scrappy, anti-plan type folk who wouldn't create a detailed year long roadmap but would create loose guidance, with tons of context, and would help the company iterate its product over time. This fitted the culture we felt was optimal.

Probably most important - our engineers told us we needed to hire a product person. They were absolutely right.

## 2. We got our board on side

We want to focus on optimizing leading indicator metrics, as high up the funnel as possible. Then we put those into our board meetings.

If we must provide further data, we do - but it goes into an appendix. We spent time to explain why this was.

We of course could have the wrong leading indicators, that's why you need your appendix data. In that case, change your leading indicators.

This is the list we currently care about:

* Quality sign ups
* Conversion rate of high quality sign ups to paid
* Deployment conversion rate
* Number of discoveries inside PostHog

## 3. We structured the company for autonomy

PostHog uses small teams, inspired by Twilio, who were inspired by Amazon. We're around 30 people, split into teams of no more than 6. The most crucial concept is that a team can ship into production without any dependencies. This optimizes for autonomy, not control.

## 4. We learned how to focus

We created a Nail X framework. You tell the company "Nail X" where X is a thing you must nail. I'm not joking. "Nail Funnels" was the first thing we did when Marcus (VP Product) joined last year. And we did. We made funnels in PostHog awesome.

Get X reference customers was another useful framework. This came out of a board meeting. We realized that we had product market fit with our free open source product, but we'd not yet worked on it for our PostHog Scale (paid product). We defined these as "genuinely delighted customers, using the product a lot, paying full price". We listed a few customers out we felt could achieve these three things to become a reference. Then we told the company to drop everything if needed to get it right with this group.

Finally, our sprints are quite key in deciding what gets built. HERE'S MORE STUFF

## 5. We wrote stuff down

This matters to us as it prevents "information silos". Sidenote: I tried hard to find a less corporate way to describe that, but couldn't.

That doesn't just apply to people reporting stuff upwards. This is what the exec team at PostHog does:

* We share our exec meetings publically in the company. Anyone can comment / read.
* We write out strategy changes into a pull request. Anyone can comment / read / suggest changes.
* We share our board meetings publically in the company. Anyonen can comment / read.
* We share realtime updates around fundraising. Not after the fact.
* We have a public handbook - which is world editable

## 6. Product should involve engineers

Product ar eproactive with getting feedback. They involve engineering - many times a day, PostHog's engineering team speak to real life users. That may be over Slack, or it may be on a call.

When engineers release new features, we'll encourage them to get one or more users to use the thing in real life. (REFERENCE SOME INTERESTING ISSUES HERE WHERE WE'VE DONE THIS - IE A/B TESTING NOTES)

# The difference it has made

This has been mind blowing. Here are a few stats for how last year when compared to the year before:

* \>8x increase in traffic
* \>4x increase in users
* \>2x increase in contributors
* 0 to (significant) revenue
* 0 to many reference customers 

Overall, it just felt easier to grow _and_ like we were losing less energy trying to prioritize things. Progress was felt calmer, but was faster.

Perhaps we were right at 2 people that product was something that fell to us, but it didn't take long for it to become critical.
